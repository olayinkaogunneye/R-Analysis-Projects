# Modern Super Bowl Analysis
#
# Title: Modern Super Bowl Analysis: Trends in TV Ratings, Ad Costs, and Halftime 
#        Performances (Super Bowls from 1987)
#
# Description:
#   This project analyzes Super Bowl data from modern times (Super Bowl from 1987)
#   to understand trends in game competitiveness, TV viewership, advertisement
#   costs, and halftime performances. The analysis examines:
#     1. The relationship between point differences and viewership.
#     2. Trends in average US viewers, household ratings, and ad costs.
#     3. How halftime show performance (number of songs, solo vs. multiple
#        artists) correlates with TV ratings.
#
# Data Sources:
#   - super_bowls.csv: Super Bowl game data (including point differences)
#   - tv.csv: TV ratings, viewership, and advertisement costs
#   - halftime_musicians.csv: Halftime show data (musician and number of songs)
#
# Note: We focus on modern Super Bowls (super_bowl from 1987) to exclude earlier, 
# less relevant games.
